## Fixes Verification Report

> **Verification report for bug fixes implemented on October 26, 2025**

### Executive Summary

All three issues identified in the comprehensive test report have been successfully fixed and verified. The application is stable, all features work correctly, and no regressions were introduced.

### Issues Fixed

#### Issue #1: Search Modal TypeError - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: TypeError when pressing Ctrl+S to open search modal:
```
TypeError: this.app.fileOps.showSearchModal is not a function
```

**Root Cause**: The AdvancedSearch class existed but was never integrated into the FileOperations class.

**Fix Applied** (`frontend/js/fileops.js`):
1. Added import: `import { AdvancedSearch } from './advanced-search.js';`
2. Initialized in constructor: `this.advancedSearch = new AdvancedSearch(app);`
3. Added showSearchModal() method to expose search functionality

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ Search modal opens correctly when pressing Ctrl+S
- ✅ No TypeError in browser console
- ✅ Search modal displays all tabs: Basic, Filters, Content, Results
- ✅ Search options and buttons functional
- ✅ Modal can be closed with Escape key

#### Issue #2: Gzip Writer Errors in main.go - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Server logs showing harmless gzip writer errors:
```
Error closing gzip writer: http: request method or response status code does not allow body
```

**Root Cause**: GzipMiddleware was logging all errors when closing the gzip writer, including expected errors for certain HTTP methods.

**Fix Applied** (`backend/main.go`):
Added error filtering to suppress harmless errors:
```go
defer func() {
    if err := gz.Close(); err != nil {
        // Ignore harmless errors
        if !strings.Contains(err.Error(), "does not allow body") &&
           !strings.Contains(err.Error(), "Content-Length") {
            log.Printf("Error closing gzip writer: %v", err)
        }
    }
}()
```

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ No gzip writer errors in server logs
- ✅ Server still logs other unexpected errors
- ✅ Compression functionality still works
- ✅ No impact on response delivery

#### Issue #3: Gzip Writer Errors in compression.go - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Similar gzip writer errors during archive compression operations.

**Fix Applied** (`backend/handlers/compression.go`):
Added same error filtering in createTarArchive function.

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ Clean server logs during testing
- ✅ Compression operations work correctly
- ✅ No harmless errors logged
- ✅ Real errors still logged properly

### Regression Testing

All major features tested to ensure no regressions:

**Navigation & UI:**
- ✅ Dual-panel interface loads correctly
- ✅ File listings display properly
- ✅ Directory navigation works
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation functional
- ✅ Status bar shows correct information

- ✅ F1 - Help dialog
- ✅ Ctrl+S - Search modal
- ✅ Ctrl+T - New tab creation
- ✅ Escape - Close modals

**Multi-Tab System:**
