## Style Guides

### Go Code Style

We follow the standard Go formatting guidelines:

```bash
# Format your code
gofmt -s -w .
goimports -w .

# Run linter
golangci-lint run

# Or use the Makefile
make format-backend
make lint-backend
```

Key points:
- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Write clear, idiomatic Go code
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors explicitly

### JavaScript Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript:

```bash
# Format your code
npm run format

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Or use the Makefile
make format-frontend
make lint-frontend
```

Key points:
- Use ES6+ features appropriately
- No framework dependencies (vanilla JavaScript only)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await for asynchronous code

### CSS Style Guide

- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keep specificity low
- Organize styles by component

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Changes to build process or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples

```
feat(storage): add support for Azure Blob Storage

Implemented Azure Blob Storage backend with full CRUD operations.
Includes authentication via connection string or managed identity.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(ui): correct panel scrolling on large directories

Fixed virtual scrolling calculation that caused jumping when
scrolling through directories with >1000 items.

Fixes #456
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run backend tests only
make test-backend

# Run frontend tests only
make test-frontend

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```

### Writing Tests

#### Go Tests

- Place test files next to the code they test
- Name test files with `_test.go` suffix
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% coverage

Example:
```go
func TestCopyFile(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        source  string
        dest    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid copy", "/tmp/source.txt", "/tmp/dest.txt", false},
        {"missing source", "/tmp/missing.txt", "/tmp/dest.txt", true},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            err := CopyFile(tt.source, tt.dest)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("CopyFile() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript Tests

- Use Jest for testing
- Place test files in `frontend/tests/`
- Mock browser APIs and external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases

## Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add JSDoc comments for JavaScript functions
- Add godoc comments for Go functions
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include examples where helpful
